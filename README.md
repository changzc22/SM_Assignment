This is a modernised Java-based Electric Train Service (ETS) Train Management and Booking System, originally developed as part of a programming course assignment. The system was implemented as a console application that manages several operational modules, including staff information, passenger registration, booking management and train scheduling. All data is stored in plain text files, while temporary runtime information is handled using ArrayLists.
